## üöÄ Getting started

The best way to start with this template is using the Gatsby CLI.

```
npx gatsby new starter-ts https://github.com/jpedroschmitz/gatsby-starter-ts
```

If you prefer you can clone this repository and run the following commands inside the project folder:

> By default, this starter uses Yarn, but this choice is yours. If you'd like to switch to npm, delete the `yarn.lock` file, install the dependencies with `npm install`, and change the CI workflows, Husky Git hooks, and lint-staged steps to use npm commands.

1. `yarn`;
2. `yarn start`;

To view the project you can open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Docker Setup

This allows you to run a dev and build environment from within a Docker container. Hopefully helps with the "it works[/doesn't work] on my machine problems" by creating a consistent environment. This requires installing [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and having it running.

1. Close this repo and move into it
1. Launch the container terminal and map files/port: `docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/site -p 8000:8000 -w /site node:16.11 bash`
1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
1. Start a dev server: `yarn start --host 0.0.0.0`


## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork this repository;
2. Create your branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`;
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`;
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`.

**After your pull request is merged**, you can safely delete your branch.
